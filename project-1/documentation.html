            The major features of my app will allow users to search up a given Genshin Impact character and learn what items they need to build said character. Users will also be able to favorite their searches so that they can come back to the website in the future in case they need to check it out again. Finally, there will be a way to like a character, as a way to see what characters are the most popular, which might also make other users more tempted to build said characters.

          <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mb-0">NOTEWORTHY</h2>
          <p>
            For this project, I used FIrebase, Bulma, Fetch, and a lot more material that was covered in class. I enjoyed learning about promises and how to use them in future assignments.
            I created web components for reusability, such as web comps for my headers and footers.

          <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mb-0">GRADING</h2>
          I think for the grade that I earned for this project should be around an 80. I struggled a lot on simple mistakes, that ended up getting me stuck for hours on end, which really slowed down my work flow. I have pretty much everything that is required, but nothing that goes above and beyond. Favorites and local storage was working a couple of hours ago, but I'm not sure what happened but now it can only favorite one item at a time instead of saving multiple like it used to be able to. There's a lot of room of improvement that can be made on this projectÂ 

          I met the requirments for this project by taking it slow and steady and not overworking myself. My goal was to get one working part at a time, and not stress about completing all the requirements all at once. I also made sure to time manage, as I know that I can get stuck on some very simple problems that can drive me completely insane, especially when I do solve it. I made sure to get Fetch working and done by the second checkpoint in order to reduce the amount of work I had to complete for the final submission. I created a lot of sketches, and wrote down my ideas and how I wanted to accomplish them. One thing that I found very helpful was to talk to my friends about my ideas, especially the ones who have never programmed in my life, as it allowed me to figure out how to solve some problems as well as fix the dumb ones.
