          <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mb-0">PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</h2>

            <a href="https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Fall-2022/blob/main/projects/p2.md">Project Requirements</a>
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mb-0">NOTEWORTHY</h2>
          <p>
            I quite like my fireworks that blossom out of the corners of the screen. I think they add a lot to
            presentation. It makes you feel like you're at a concert listening to this music, with the colorful lights
            adding to the overall display.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mb-0">GRADING</h2>
          <p>
            For my grade for this project. I think I'm sitting around a mid B. My project fulfills every requirement,
            but I did struggle quite a bit with the sandbox portion in the beginning. Once I found my groove, things got
            better but it still took me a bit to get the creative juices going, as I had a lot on my plate, espeically
            from other class projects. I had orignally planned to either make a sprite animated or create my own but I
            got a bit intimidated by it. I still want to do it, but I won't be able to get it done by the deadline. I'll
            try to research and create my own for to polish this website even more.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mb-0">TO DO</h2>
          <p>
            I want to try to create my own sprites and animate them onto this website. I ran out of time and was very
            confused, but with the unlimited time after the submission to work on it, and not any other work to do over
            the break, I'm going to try and research it.
